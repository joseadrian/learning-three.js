# Importing from blender

I was looking how to import models created on blender using Three.js and I thought it was going to be difficult. 

There is a [Beginners guide made by Team Threehouse](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/the-beginners-guide-to-three-js) in which they explain how to use the exported file. There is also the implement of **OrbitControls** to move, zoom and pan. They provide you a logo but I decided to start using blender and well... I just created 2 basic shapes.

## OrbitControls

- **Left click**: Move around
- **Scroll wheel**: zoom in/out
- **Right Click**: Pan
